### Slide types

1. **Title**. Defined in the YAML header.
2. **Section header**. Break the presentation into sections. These slides have a section header but no content.
3. **Title and content**. Presentation content.
4. **Two Content**. Presentation content in two columns.

### Setting the slide level

By default, the slide level is the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another header, somewhere in the document. Override using the `slide-level` option. For details, see *Structuring the Slide Show* in the [Pandoc Manual](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).

### Rules

* A horizontal rule always starts a new slide
* A header at the slide level always starts a new slide
* Headers below the slide level in the hierarchy create headers within a slide
* Headers above the slide level in the hierarchy create *section headers*
* A title page is constructed automatically from the documentâ€™s title block

# Example

### Slide Level: 3
