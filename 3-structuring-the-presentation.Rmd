### Markdown Headers

You can structure your presentation with section and content slides using a hierarchy of markdown headers. 

```

# Level 1

## Level 2

### Level 3

```

### Slide Level

The slide level is the header level that creates content slides from the Title and Content or Two Content layouts. Your R Markdown document is carved up into slides according to rules.

### Rules

* Headers at the slide level always starts a new slide
* Headers above the slide level in the hierarchy create section headers
* Headers below the slide level in the hierarchy create headers within a slide
* A horizontal rule always starts a new slide
* A title page is constructed automatically from the documentâ€™s title block

### Setting the Slide Level

In order to structure a PowerPoint presentation, Pandoc needs to determine which header level should be used for the slide level. 

**By default, Pandoc sets the slide level to the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content somewhere in the document.**

# Examples

### Slide Level: 3

```

# Section header (First slide)

## Section header (Second slide)

### Title (Third slide)
Content (this sets the default slide level)

#### Content header (Third slide)

##### Content header (Third slide)
```

### Slide Level: 1

If you do not want to structure your slides into sections, you can just use level 1 headers to create all your slides.
